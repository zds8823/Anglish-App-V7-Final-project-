This application was developed for my final project at Aacadia university the goal was to use Augmented reality to create a fishing app that would allow recreational
fishers to share their catches and take measurements and estimate the weight of their catches using their phones camera.

the current version of the app allows users to log a image of their catches that are saved to a json file and then user can add information about their catch after logging the photo or when ever is convinenient by accessing the users personal log. Users are able to view other users recent catches or search throught the public or personal logs using the information users inpout into their logs (ie. Species or location)
